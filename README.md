# Joker

> Some men just want to watch the world burn.

In the vein of Netflix's [Chaos Engineering](http://techblog.netflix.com/2014/09/introducing-chaos-engineering.html) and Aphyr's [Jepsen](https://github.com/aphyr/jepsen) testing, Joker seeks to create reproducible failures in distributed systems and observe the behavior of systems under partial failure.
